## Code Snippet
I know it's a very simple code but this, along with appending to the DOM and the media query were my main struggles. This was the last part of my MVP as I had everything else in tact. But once I was able to figure out this code and where to place the removeRandomSearch function, I felt so much joy. I can say that I now understand how the remove function works. It's a bit easier when applying it to the search bar, but when it came to the random quote button, I had to place it in a specific spot in order for it to work. 

``` function removeQuotes(quoteArray) {
  while (quoteArray.lastChild) {
    quoteArray.removeChild(quoteArray.lastChild)
  }
}
function removeRandomSearch(response) {
  while (response.lastChild) {
    response.removeChild(response.lastChild)
  }
}
```
## Change Log
 I did decide not to style my quotes just because it was too late and I tend to stress for hours over the simplest code. 
 I also chose not to put images  on the sides of the webpage because I felt like it would have ended up looking messy. But I'm content with how simple it looks now, I'm pretty proud of myself for creating a functional website even though it's not the prettiest.
